Cloud Computing notes


structure of azure  :- 

Azure poratal
tannit : Subscribsion related
service :
resources : 


We will create a virtual machine and it will be only accessed if we have an active subscription.

Ai and ds ke resources resource group mai daalo name and Virtual machine ka naam rakho for future identification.

Choose a region of Datacenter according to the user.

Availbility does cost but i garuntees copies of VM in diffrent zones also do explore security default is standard

image is nothing but configueration of operating systems use of linux is prefferd as it is free else it will be charged For AI there are diffrent specific image

Size mai alag alag configueration hai jiski cost vary karti hai month to month

Authentication is a key based association which is more secure than a password 

port ke through hii acess kar sakte hai defualt ssh22 open rahega

select type and space of a disk required as per application basis also affects.
the  cost

v-net(virtualNetwork) is basically bahar se anne pe authenticate karega par ek baar authenticate hone ke baad too and fro communicate karsakte hai 
like frontend -backend server which cannot be accesed by public

if diffrent virtual machines are connected using v-net then they can communicate hassle free

Public IP needed hai yaa nahi uska cost padta hai like for website hosting we require a IP

Then we can deploy if we want to change more.

Important :::::: Access Control feature after deployment ............ hum role bana sakte hai access de sakte hai particual cheezo ki good during production Eamil password generate hoga just like wordpress.

For accessing 
Username
Password
IP address : 
20.235.114.214

sshkey se kiya hoga toh yeh command use karo :
 ssh -i {path of pem key}/username@ipaddress


how to deploy flask on server : 

app.py mai code hai
port 5000 pe acess karega

flask locally installed hai github pe dall denge and url generate karega

fir server ko access karo : pehle root user pe switch karo (linux)
admin(windows)
[sudo su]

vi app.py (directly) create app.py and type code +(i) for insert

to save ESC
:wq <enter]

Need to install all dependencies even pip so we need to install it

If python is installed locally
[apt update]
[apt upgrade]

install pip and flask :

[apt install python3 pip]
[pip3 install flask]
[htop] for cpu management
[python3 app.py] to run flask

To deploy we need to configure network inbound port rule  settings and give access to ip address dash board mai jaa ke and if myIp address hoga toh same device hii access kar paayegi 

Just figure out how to keep it deployed.


****************************************

Create a web app (PaaS) we need unique name
publish : code/static webpage
Runtime stack : The code you used in (python3.8)

\ after deploying take the custom domain and open deployment center


Either push from Github or manually push using git ;

git clone https://github.com/vrmaverick/Flask_Implementation.git
ls
cd Flask_Implementation/
ls
