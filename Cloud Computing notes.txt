Cloud Computing notes


structure of azure  :- 

Azure poratal
tannit : Subscribsion related
service :
resources : 


We will create a virtual machine and it will be only accessed if we have an active subscription.

Ai and ds ke resources resource group mai daalo name and Virtual machine ka naam rakho for future identification.

Choose a region of Datacenter according to the user.

Availbility does cost but i garuntees copies of VM in diffrent zones also do explore security default is standard

image is nothing but configueration of operating systems use of linux is prefferd as it is free else it will be charged For AI there are diffrent specific image

Size mai alag alag configueration hai jiski cost vary karti hai month to month

Authentication is a key based association which is more secure than a password 

port ke through hii acess kar sakte hai defualt ssh22 open rahega

select type and space of a disk required as per application basis also affects.
the  cost

v-net(virtualNetwork) is basically bahar se anne pe authenticate karega par ek baar authenticate hone ke baad too and fro communicate karsakte hai 
like frontend -backend server which cannot be accesed by public

if diffrent virtual machines are connected using v-net then they can communicate hassle free

Public IP needed hai yaa nahi uska cost padta hai like for website hosting we require a IP

Then we can deploy if we want to change more.

Important :::::: Access Control feature after deployment ............ hum role bana sakte hai access de sakte hai particual cheezo ki good during production Eamil password generate hoga just like wordpress.

For accessing 
Username
Password
IP address : 
20.235.114.214

sshkey se kiya hoga toh yeh command use karo :
 ssh -i {path of pem key}/username@ipaddress
